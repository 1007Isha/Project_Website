        <h3><u>INTRODUCTION</u></h3><br>
        <ul>
        <li>The choice of the correct variety plays a very important role in achieving optimum yield. For deciding on a variety for cultivation under irrigated conditions, the following are very important considerations:  </li>
        <br>
        <p> i. Disease resistance 
        <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ii. Fertilizer responsiveness 
        <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; iii. Lodging and shattering resistance and
        <br>iv. Desired maturity</p> 

        <li> Under rain-fed conditions, the ability to withstand soil and atmospheric drought is most needed. If the right variety is not present, production technologies cannot be applied effectively  </li>
